## 2.Exploratory Data Analysis

### a) Examining the Target Variable, 'Price'

 i) Examining the Correlation between Features and Price
 
ii) Examination of Association of Ordinal Features with the Target Variable, Price

iii) Examination of Association of Continuous Features with the PriceÂ¶

iv) Examination of Association of Waterfront feature with the Price

### b) Building a Mutiple Linear Regression Model

 *Feature Selection*
  
   Assumptions
   
    + Multicollinearity
   
    + Linear relationship between explanatory and response variables
   
    + Homoscedasticity of error terms
   
    + Normal distribution of model residuals
   
      
Selected Feautures;For the Model I selected 4 feautures that had the highest correlation with price and did not violate the multocorrelianity assumption:

+ grade
+ bathrooms
+ sqft_living15
+ sqft_living

   
 *Modelling*
 
   *Methodology for Creating the Multiple Linear Regression Model*
    
    Created a new DataFrame with the selected variables:

     The variables 'bathrooms', 'grade', 'sqft_living', and 'sqft_living15' are chosen as the predictors for the regression model.
     A new DataFrame called 'df_selected' is created to store these selected variables.
     
     Updated the target variable and the sqft variables to their natural logarithm:

     The target variable 'price' is transformed using the natural logarithm.
     The variables 'sqft_living' and 'sqft_living15' are also transformed using the natural logarithm.
     Taking the logarithm can help to normalize the data and improve the model's performance.
     
    Performed ordinal encoding on the 'grade' column:

     The 'grade' column, which represents an ordinal feature, is encoded using the OrdinalEncoder.
     Ordinal encoding assigns a numerical value to each category based on its order or rank.
     
    Converted the data types of the columns to numeric:

     The data types of the columns 'bathrooms', 'grade', 'sqft_living', and 'sqft_living15' are converted to float to ensure consistency and ompatibility with the regression model.
     
    Added a constant column to the DataFrame:

    A constant column is added to the DataFrame using the sm.add_constant() function.
    This constant column represents the intercept term in the regression model.
    
    Fitting the multiple regression model:

    The multiple regression model was then fitted using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method from the statsmodels library.
    The target variable 'price' was regressed on the other predictor variables in the DataFrame.
    The results of the regression model were then stored in the 'results' variable.
    
By following these steps, the code prepared the data and fitted a multiple regression model to predict house prices based on the selected variables. The regression results were further analyzed and interpreted to understand the relationships between the predictors and the target variable.

The low MSE and RMSE values denote the success of this model in predicting house prices
The difference between the two MSE/RMSE values is relatively small, indicating that the model's performance is consistent across both the training and testing sets.



### d) Interpretation of Model Results



+ The model has an R-squared value of 0.534, indicating that approximately 53.4% of the variation in house prices can be explained by the included variables: bathrooms, grade, square footage of living space, and square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors(sqft_living15).

+ The highly significant F-statistic of 6000 suggests that the overall model is statistically significant, meaning that the combined effects of the independent variables significantly contribute to predicting house prices.

+ The intercept coefficient (const) is estimated to be 8.1050, indicating that when all other variables are zero, the average price of a house is estimated to be $8.1050 million.

+ The coefficient for the number of bathrooms (bathrooms) is -0.0228, indicating that, on average, each additional bathroom is associated with a decrease of $22,800 in house price, holding other factors constant.

+ The coefficient for the grade of the house (grade) is 0.1879, suggesting that a higher grade is associated with a higher house price. Each unit increase in grade leads to an increase of $187,900 in price.

+ The coefficient for the square footage of living space (sqft_living) is 0.3621, indicating that an increase in the square footage of living space is associated with a higher house price. Each unit increase in square footage leads to an increase of $362,100 in price.

+ The coefficient for the square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors (sqft_living15) is 0.1830, suggesting that more living space among the nearest 15 neighbors is associated with a higher house price. Each unit increase in sqft_living15 leads to an increase of $183,000 in price.

+ The standard errors associated with these coefficients provide a measure of the precision of the estimates. The low p-values indicate that all the coefficients are statistically significant, suggesting that they have a significant impact on house prices.

The analysis reveals that a higher grade, less bathrooms, and larger square footage of living space and interior living space among of the nearest 15 neighbors are associated with higher house prices. 



## 3.Conclusions


+ The multiple regression model demonstrates that approximately 53.4% of the variation in house prices can be explained by the included variables: the number of bathrooms, grade, square footage of living space, and square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors.

+ The highly significant F-statistic of 6000 indicates that the overall model is statistically significant, signifying that the combined effects of the independent variables significantly contribute to predicting house prices.

+ The coefficients offer valuable insights into the relationship between the independent variables and house prices:

     + Each additional bathroom is associated with a decrease of $22,800 in house price, holding other factors constant

     + A higher grade is linked to a higher house price, with each unit increase in grade leading to an increase of $187,900 in price.

     + An increase in the square footage of living space is associated with a higher house price, with each unit increase resulting in an increase of $362,100 in price.

+ More square footage of interior housing living space among the nearest 15 neighbors (sqft_living15) is connected to a higher house price, with each unit increase leading to an increase of $183,000 in price.

+ The normality assumption of the model is satisfied based on the QQ-plot of the model residuals. Additionally, the scatter plot of residuals vs predicted values indicates that the residuals are centered around zero and exhibit random patterns, suggesting that the multiple linear regression assumptions are reasonably met.

+ The low MSE and RMSE values demonstrate the success of this model in predicting house prices in the King County housing market. These results provide confidence in the model's ability to estimate house prices accurately, which can be valuable for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions in the real estate market.The difference between the two MSE/RMSE values is relatively small, indicating that the model's performance is consistent across both the training and testing sets.


## 4.Recommenations

_Consumers/Investors_

+ When evaluating house prices, consider the factors included in the multiple regression model: number of bathrooms, grade, square footage of living space, and square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors (sqft_living15).

+ Pay attention to the quality and grade of a house, as higher grades are associated with higher prices. This information can be useful when comparing properties or making investment decisions.

+ Consider the impact of square footage of living space on house prices. A larger living space is associated with higher prices, so this factor should be taken into account when assessing property values.

+ While the model indicates that more bathrooms are associated with lower prices, it is important to consider other factors and individual preferences. Some buyers may value additional bathrooms, so it's essential to evaluate the overall appeal and functionality of a property.

_Data Professionals_

+ The model assumes linearity and other assumptions of multiple regression. When making predictions or drawing conclusions, it is crucial to consider these assumptions and their potential limitations.

+ Regularly assess and validate the model's performance using metrics such as MSE. This will help gauge the accuracy and predictive power of the model and identify any potential areas for improvement.

+ There is still room for improvement. It is important to consider additional evaluation metrics and potentially explore other modeling approaches to further optimize the model's performance.

+ Other factors beyond those included in the model may also influence house prices. Consider incorporating additional variables or exploring alternative models to capture a more comprehensive understanding of house price dynamics in the real estate domain.
